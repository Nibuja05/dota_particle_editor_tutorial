<h1 id="part-1-creating-the-circle">Part 1: Creating the circle</h1>
<p>In this first part we're going to create the base effect: a spinning magic circle on the ground:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cypsRRb.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2>
<p>First of all let's create a new particle effect. We won't use any other resource, so we start with completly fresh and empty Particle Editor. To so open the Editor and press <em>Ctrl + N</em> to create a new particle effect.<br>
It's good practice to save the effect at the start, so let's save this effect (pressing <em>Ctrl + Shift + S</em>) right away. It is also recommended to create a new folder for this effect and all its children. So we create a folder named <code>magic_circle</code> and save this file there with the name <code>magic_circle.vpcf</code>.</p>
<p>Now we want to add the bare minimum of functions we need for this particle to function. So we need an emitter, some decay and a render sprites.</p>
<p><em>Add everything you think might be needed now. If you think you're done, you can see the solution below.</em></p>

	Basic Functionality
	Muhahahah!

<p>Spoiler text. Note that it's important to have a space after the summary tag. You should be able to write any markdown you want inside the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> tag... just make sure you close <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> afterward.</p>
