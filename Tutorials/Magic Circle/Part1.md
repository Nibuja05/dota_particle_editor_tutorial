# Part 1: Creating the circle

In this first part we're going to create the base effect: a spinning magic circle on the ground:

## The basics

First of all let's create a new particle effect. We won't use any other resource, so we start with completly fresh and empty Particle Editor. To so open the Editor and press *Ctrl + N* to create a new particle effect.
It's good practice to save the effect at the start, so let's save this effect (pressing *Ctrl + Shift + S*) right away. It is also recommended to create a new folder for this effect and all its children. So we create a folder named `magic_circle` and save this file there with the name `magic_circle.vpcf`.

Now we want to add the bare minimum of functions we need for this particle to function. So we need an emitter, some decay and a render sprites.

*Add everything you think might be needed now. If you think you're done, you can see the solution below.*
