<p>Creating particles is no easy matter in the first place, but making particles scale for all desired use cases is a way harder challenge. But a well scaling and controllable particle effect can also make a huge difference and is definitely worth is effort.<br>
In this tutorial I will cover the basic methods of creating well scaling particle effects as well as some scenarios you might encounter while creating effects and what do in these cases.</p>

<h3 id="control-points">Control points</h3>
<p>No matter how you want to let your particle scale, you always need Control Points to transmit the data to your particle effect.<br>
I would recommend to use as less control points to control your effect as possible and to use all three (x,y and z) fields of the input vectors for all needed values. Please also be aware of what CPs are usually used for control inputs (<a href="./Basic%20Knowledge.md#control-points">see here</a>).</p>
